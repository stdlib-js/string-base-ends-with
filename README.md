    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Test if a string ends with the characters of another string.

<section class="intro">

<!-- /.intro -->



<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
endsWith = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-ends-with@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var endsWith = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/string-base-ends-with/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-ends-with@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.endsWith;
})();
</script>
```

#### endsWith( str, search, len )

Tests if a string ends with the characters of another string.

```javascript
var str = 'Remember the story I used to tell you when you were a boy?';

var bool = endsWith( str, 'boy?', str.length );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'Boy?', str.length );
// returns false
```

To search from a specific character position, provide a `len` argument. If `len` is positive, the function restricts the search to a substring with length `len`, beginning with the leftmost character. If `len` is negative, `len` indicates to ignore the last `len` characters (equivalent to `str.length + len`).

```javascript
var str = 'To be, or not to be, that is the question.';

var bool = endsWith( str, 'to be', 19 );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'to be', -23 );
// returns true
```

If provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `true`.

```javascript
var str = 'beep boop';

var bool = endsWith( str, '' );
// returns true
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   In general, exercise caution when operating on substrings containing Unicode characters, as the visual character length may not equal the number of code points. For example,

    ```javascript
    var len = '🏠'.length;
    // returns 2
    ```

-   This function differs from [`String.prototype.endsWith`][mdn-string-endswith] in the following ways:

    -   The function assumes string values for the first and second arguments and assumes that the `len` argument is an integer value.
    -   The function does **not** clamp positive `len` values to the end of the input string.
    -   Except when provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `false` is a `len` resolves to a starting search position which exceeds the bounds of the input string.

var bool = endsWith( str, 'air', str.length );

// returns false

bool = endsWith( str, 'fair', 30 );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'fair', -34 );
// returns true

})();
