    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/string-base-ends-with
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var endsWith = require( '@stdlib/string-base-ends-with' );
```

#### endsWith( str, search, len )

Tests if a string ends with the characters of another string.

```javascript
var str = 'Remember the story I used to tell you when you were a boy?';

var bool = endsWith( str, 'boy?', str.length );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'Boy?', str.length );
// returns false
```

To search from a specific character position, provide a `len` argument. If `len` is positive, the function restricts the search to a substring with length `len`, beginning with the leftmost character. If `len` is negative, `len` indicates to ignore the last `len` characters (equivalent to `str.length + len`).

```javascript
var str = 'To be, or not to be, that is the question.';

var bool = endsWith( str, 'to be', 19 );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'to be', -23 );
// returns true
```

If provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `true`.

```javascript
var str = 'beep boop';

var bool = endsWith( str, '' );
// returns true
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   In general, exercise caution when operating on substrings containing Unicode characters, as the visual character length may not equal the number of code points. For example,

    ```javascript
    var len = 'üè†'.length;
    // returns 2
    ```

-   This function differs from [`String.prototype.endsWith`][mdn-string-endswith] in the following ways:

    -   The function assumes string values for the first and second arguments and assumes that the `len` argument is an integer value.
    -   The function does **not** clamp positive `len` values to the end of the input string.
    -   Except when provided an empty `search` string, the function **always** returns `false` if `len` resolves to a starting search position which exceeds the bounds of the input string.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var endsWith = require( '@stdlib/string-base-ends-with' );

var str = 'Fair is foul, and foul is fair, hover through fog and filthy air';

var bool = endsWith( str, 'air', str.length );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'fair', str.length );
// returns false

bool = endsWith( str, 'fair', 30 );
// returns true

bool = endsWith( str, 'fair', -34 );
// returns true
```
